       "'Complete Specification\\n\\nA HOLLOW FIBER MODULE HAVING THIN FILM COMPOSITE- AQUAPORIN MODIFIED MEMBRANES FIELD OF THE INVENTION \\n\\nThe present invention relates to a hollow fiber (HF) module having thin film composite (TFC) modified fiber membranes, such as having a polyamide TFC layer on the outside or inside of the fibers, or on both sides, and comprising aquaporin water channels in said TFC layer. The present invention also relates to a hollow fiber membrane having a thin film composite (TFC) modified separation layer comprising aquaporin water channels, such as having a polyamide TFC layer on the outside or inside of the fibers and to a method of preparing said TFC modification directly on the fibers as mounted in the module and where said TFC layer comprises aquaporin water channels immobilised or embedded in said layer.\\n\\n\\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n\\nRecently, it has been shown how thin film composite hollow fiber membranes can be prepared for forward osmosis (Sukitpaneenit & Chung 2012) through interfacial polymerization creating a polyamide thin layer on the inner surface of PES hollow fiber support membranes where a 2 wt % of meta-phenylene diamine (MPD) aqueous solution containing 0.5 wt % of triethylamine and 0.1 wt % of sodium dodecyl sulfate is introduced through pumping from a bottom inlet into a vertically positioned HF module followed by air drying and then introduction of a 0.15 wt % of trimesoyl chloride (TMC) in hexane solution to form the polyamide thin film and finally purging with air and curing at 65 °C, rinsing with deionized water and storing in deionized water. Furthermore, Peinemann et al. describes a method of preparing a similar TFC layer on the interior surface of a hollow fiber, cf. US published patent application No. 2007/0199892. \\n\\nMoreover, Zhong et al. (2013) describe the development of TFC forward osmosis hollow fiber membranes using direct sulfonated polyphenylenesulfone as membrane substrate. However, for a wide range of separation applications where hollow fiber modules are employed it is of importance to be able to separate or filter out organic solutes of relatively low molecular weight during the filtration process. For example, in \\n\\nhaemodialysis where HF modules are widely used, a uremic toxin and organic degradation product, such as indoxyl sulfate (Indoxyl sulfate potassium salt, CAS Number 2642-37-7, molecular weight 251.30) poses a particularly difficult problem. Indoxyl sulfate is accumulated in the serum of chronic kidney disease patients. A part of the dietary protein-derived tryptophan is metabolized into indole by tryptophanase in intestinal bacteria. Indole is absorbed into the blood from the intestine, and is \\n\\nmetabolized to indoxyl sulfate in the liver. Indoxyl sulfate is normally excreted into urine. In haemodialysis patients, however, an inadequate renal clearance of indoxyl sulfate leads to its elevated serum levels, cf. Niwa T. (2010). Niwa et al. (1997) have advanced the hypothesis that accumulation of indoxyl sulfate accelerates glomerular sclerosis and progression of kidney disease. Administration of an oral adsorbent lowers indoxyl sulfate levels in undialyzed uraemic patients, cf Niwa et al. (1997). Current dialysis methods, i.e. haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the latter being characterised by continuous ultrafiltration and solute removal, do not sufficiently remove some low molecular weight degradation products from serum, such as indoxyl sulfate and /?-cresol (4-methylphenol, CAS No. 106-44-5, molecular weight 108.13). In addition, small water-soluble molecules, such as urea, uric acid and creatinine, and peptides/proteins, such as p2-microglobulin should preferably be removed during dialysis. A direct association between p-cresol, mainly reflecting / cresyl sulfate, and overall mortality and \\n\\ncardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease and in chronic kidney disease has been found. Likewise, direct associations between indoxyl sulfate and overall mortality and cardiovascular disease has been reported. In continuous hemofiltration therapy loss of physiological (vital) proteins should be minimized and removal of low (< 500 Da) and middle molecular weight (from about 500 to about 40 kDa) uremic toxins and peptides should be optimized, cf. Wenhao Xie (201 1).\\n\\n\\nAoike (2011) mentions the most important features or quality parameters for high performance membranes for use in hemopurification therapies, i.e., high water \\n\\npermeability, capability to remove a wide range of uremic toxins and other characteristic features. However, Aoike also points out that large pore size of existing high \\n\\nperformance membranes (HPM) will likely allow blood to be contaminated by the dialysis fluid, because HPMs, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes, having a large pore size allow untoward rapid diffusion of dialyzed endotoxin fragments back into the blood compartment.\\n\\n\\nAccordingly, it remains a problem in the art in providing hollow fiber modules that are able to separate low molecular weight compounds, enabling their removal from liquids in processes such as haemodialysis and in which the hollow fibre module combine a high water permeability with smaller pore sizes.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n\\nBroadly, the present invention provides a hollow fiber module which is able to separate low molecular weight compounds, for example enabling the HF module to concentrate organic compounds, including urea, indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol and/or p-cresyl sulfate and preferably compounds having a molecular weight of less than about 500 Da and thus enable improved removal of said compounds, e.g. from a liquid.

In addition, various doping materials may be used when manufacturing the hollow fiber support materials, cf. e.g. Qian Yang et al. (2009). Such HF modules are commonly used in food and beverage applications such as filtering beer and wine, but also in some water and wastewater applications including wastewater reuse and pool water recycling. For instance, the \\n\\nGerman company Membrana supplies a hollow fiber module containing several thousands of fibers with an overall surface area of 75 square meters per module. Smaller modules with typically 1 -2 square meters and around 8,000 to 20,000 fibers are commonly used in medical dialysis applications (Fresenius Medical Care, Gambro). In principle, all these commercial products can be coated through interfacial polymerization using the method of the invention resulting in a thin film composite layer wherein aquaporin water channels are incorporated, preferably during its formation, such as by adding a suitable protein suspension or solution, preferably in vesicle form, to the aqueous reactive amine solution, e.g. a meta-phenylene diamine solution, and pumping or injecting the combined solution through the support fibers, removing excess solution and subsequently pumping or injecting a reactive acyl chloride in organic solvent, e.g. \\n\\ntrimesoyl chloride in hexane, and finally rinsing with deionized water, e.g. MilliQ™ water. The housing material of the HF modules of the invention can be any suitable material commonly used for HF modules, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, PVDF and stainless steel. The fibers may be sealed into the HF module housing using commonly known epoxy adhesive materials and the like. Additional examples of HF modules that may be TFC modified according to the invention are found on websites of membrane producers, such as:\\n\\nhttp://ww&#923; membranafiltratio .com/flltration-modules/documentation.cfm \\n\\nhttp://www.kochmembrane.com/PDFs/KMS_Puron_Hollow Fiber PSH300_PSH600_P SH1800_Modul.aspx \\n\\nhttp://www.kochmembrane.com/Membrane-Products/Hollow-Fiber/Ultrafiltration/PURON-Series.aspx \\n\\nhttp://www.daicen.co.jp/english/membrane/kogata.html \\n\\nhttp://www.spectmmlabs.com/filtration/hfmods.html \\n\\nhttp://www.microdyn-nadir.com/en/Products/\\n\\n\\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the HF module is operated with counter-current flow of draw and feed solutions. In another embodiment of the present invention the HF module is operated with co-current flow of draw and feed solutions. In a further embodiment of the invention the HF module is operated with the draw solution against the TFC layer. In a still further embodiment of the invention the HF module is operated with the feed solution against the TFC layer. In addition, the modified hollow fibres of the invention may be mounted in a system or module for use as a membrane bio-reactor (MBR), where the MBR module containing the hollow fibres is submerged in an aqueous liquid and where purified water is removed from said liquid through the fibres by the use of a draw solution or by application of a moderate suction pressure.\\n\\n\\nA further aspect of the invention relates to a method of making a hollow fiber membrane modified with a thin film composite (TFC) layer comprising aquaporin water channels, where the TFC layer comprising aquaporin water channels is prepared directly on the surface of membrane fibers mounted and sealed in a HF module, said method comprising the steps of: \\n\\na) obtaining an aquaporin vesicles suspension (proteoliposomes or \\n\\nproteopolymersomes) having from about 25 to about 500 LPR/POPR (ratio based on mole content) (preferably 100 LPR/POPR for lipid/diblock copolymer, 50 POPR for triblock copolymer) of protein, \\n\\nb) preparing an aqueous solution of a diamine, such as 1,3-diaminobenzene, to obtain a solution of about 1% to about 5 %, such as about 2.5 to 4.2% (w/w) \\n\\nconcentration, \\n\\nc) dissolving an acyl chloride, such as benzene- 1, 3, 5-tricarbonyl chloride in a hydrocarbon solvent, such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane having a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain to or mixtures of these, such as isoalkane hydrocarbon solvent obtain a concentration of about 0.05% to about 1 %, such as about 0.15% (w/v), d) preparing a diamine /aquaporin vesicle mixture, such asl,3-diaminobenzene/aquaporin vesicle mixture by dissolving/mixing the vesicles preparation from step a) with the solution from step b), \\n\\ne) pumping the mixture from step d) through the lumen of the hollow fibers in a hollow fiber module using its end inlet, \\n\\nf) removing excess diamine by a gas purging of the lumen side of the fibers using a module inlet, \\n\\ng) injecting the acyl chloride solution from step c) into the module through an inlet to allow an interfacial polymerization reaction to take place, and \\n\\nh) rinsing the module with an aqueous solvent by injection through a module inlet.\\n\\n\\nOptionally, after filling with water the module is sealed with tight caps to prevent it from drying out. \\n\\nA further aspect of the invention relates to a method of outside coating a hollow fiber membrane with a thin film composite (TFC) layer comprising aquaporin water channels, said method comprising the steps of: \\n\\na) obtaining an aquaporin vesicles suspension (proteoliposomes or \\n\\nproteopolymersomes), \\n\\nb) preparing an aqueous solution of a di- or triamine, \\n\\nc) dissolving a di- or triacyl halide in an apolar organic solvent, \\n\\nd) preparing a mixture of amine and aquaporin vesicle by dissolving/mixing the vesicles preparation from step a) with the solution from step b), \\n\\ne) passing the hollow fiber membrane through the mixture from step d), f) removing excess aqueous solution, \\n\\ng) passing the hollow fiber membrane through the acyl halide solution from step c) to allow an interfacial polymerization reaction to take place, and \\n\\nh) rinsing the hollow fiber membrane with an aqueous solvent, e.g. by passing the hollow fibre through a water bath.\\n\\n\\nIn the above described methods of coating the hollow fiber membrane and preparing the hollow fiber module, the steps a)-c) may be performed in any convenient order. Also the step c) may be performed before or after step d).\\n\\n\\nIn exemplary embodiments, said liposomes used in the preparation of the HF module of the invention are prepared from lipids such as DPhPC, DOPC, mixed soy bean lipids, such as asolectin and soy lecithin, or E. coli mixed lipids; and said polymersomes may comprise triblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe-hydrophile (A-B-A or A-B-C) type or diblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe type (A-B).\\n\\n\\nIn a further embodiment said polymersomes may comprise a combination of triblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe-hydrophile type and diblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe type. In the combinations the diblock copolymers may comprise from about 10 mole % to about 60 mole %, such as from about 25 mole % to about 50 mole %. \\n\\nSaid aquaporin water channels are preferably AqpZ channels, but, in principle, all water selective aquaporins, e.g. such as aquaporin Z (AqpZ), Aqpl, GlpF or SoPIP2;l , are useful in the invention.\\n\\nSaid TFC layer is preferably formed through interfacial polymerization of an aqueous solution of an amine with a solution of an acid chloride in an organic solvent, and wherein the aquaporin water channel vesicles are incorporated in said aqueous solution. \\n\\nSaid aquaporin water channels are preferably incorporated in vesicles before \\n\\nincorporation into the TFC layer of the hollow fiber membrane of the invention, and said vesicles may be in the form of liposomes or polymersomes, where said liposomes are prepared from lipids such as DPhPC, DOPC, mixed soy bean lipids, or E. coli mixed lipids, and said polymersomes comprise triblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe-hydrophile (A-B-A or A-B-C) type or diblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe type (A-B). In a further embodiment said polymersomes may comprise a combination of triblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe-hydrophile type and diblock copolymers of the hydrophile-hydrophobe type.\\n\\n\\nThe HF membrane of the invention has preferably a TFC layer formed through interfacial polymerization of an aqueous solution of an amine with a solution of an acid chloride in an organic solvent, and wherein the aquaporin water channel vesicles are incorporated in said aqueous solution.\\n\\n\\nIn one embodiment of the method of preparing the HF module of the invention the fibers are gas purged to blow off excess water in step f) and the module is held upside down in step f).\\n\\n\\nIn a further aspect of the present invention, a hollow fiber module having high water permeability and small pore sizes, such as having a pore diameter of less than about 5 to 10 nm, such as equal to or less than about 1 nm, is provided. Formation of a separation layer in the form of a thin film layer as known in the art onto the surface of a support membrane fiber results in changes to the water transport mechanism. Instead of water transport taking place by normal diffusion through the pores of the support membrane, another type of water transport takes place through the thin film layer as is known from this type of reverse osmosis membranes, where membrane permeability is limited. The \\n\\nnonporous nature of the thin film separating layer results in transport of water requiring\\n\\n\"jump diffusion\" as described in Kotelyanskii et al. 1998. Thus, thin film modification of water membranes have mainly found use in reverse osmosis, where a hydrostatic pressure is required to force the water through the membrane, and the obtained advantage lies in the improved separation of unwanted solutes in the water to be filtered. These conventional membranes for reverse osmosis have effectively 100-200 nm thick non-porous layers supported by a porous material. Water permeation in these membranes occurs as a diffusion process through the non-porous layer established via the appearance and disappearance of interstitial spaces. The HF module of the present invention may be further improved relative to the prior art reverse osmosis membranes by having aquaporin water channels incorporated in the thin film layer making it a thin film composite (TFC) layer. The incorporation of aquaporins have the added benefit of providing a selective water transport through its pores having a diameter of only 2.4 A at its narrowest passage (AqpZ pore, cf. Wang et al. 2005) where an efficient single file water transport takes place. The HF module of the invention combines the advantages of having a thin film separation layer together with aquaporin water channels thus providing improved separation as well as water flux through Angstrom sized pores making the HF module suitable for both reverse osmosis, forward osmosis, assisted forward osmosis, \\n\\nnano filtration etc.\\n\\n\\nDEFINITIONS \\n\\nThe term \"hollow fiber membrane\" and \"HF membrane\" as used herein refers to any type of capillary membrane which can be used for liquid filtration purposes.\\n\\nThe term \"polyethersulfone\" as used herein refers to a membrane material used in the fabrication of hollow fiber modules.

(4) Represents the aquaporin protein where its tetrameric form is shown. \\n\\nHowever, the protein may also be present as a monomer or as a dimer, both of which are also water channels.\\n\\n\\nFiltration results using forward osmosis \\n\\nTables 1 and 2 below show filtration results in the form of measured water flux, Jw, and measured reverse salt flux, Js, for HF modules prepared according to the invention using a feed solution of 10 &#956;&#924; calcein (CAS No. 1461-15-0, Mw 622.55) and a draw solution of 2 M NaCl both in deionized water (MilliQ water) and where the TFC-aquaporin layer is formed on the inside of hollow fibers (lumen) and the draw solution is applied to the outside or inside of the fibers. Co-current or counter-current flow was used. Referring to Fig. 1 : Typically, feed solution was pumped through inlet (1) and out through (2), and draw solution was pumped through inlet (3) and out through (4). In five experiments a counter-current flow was used, cf. Tables 1 and 2 and description below. The water channel protein AqpZ was used in all experiments, and both a lipid (asolectin) and various block copolymers (P3691, P8061) were vesicle membrane materials. \\n\\nEach experiment is characterised by the water flux (Jw), the reverse salt flux (Js) and the calcein rejection. The water flux describes how much water is transported over a certain amount of membrane area in a given time (usually L/m2h) and is measured by monitoring the weight loss in the feed solution. The reverse salt flux characterises the amount of draw solute that diffuses back into the feed solution. It is an indicator on how salt-tight a membrane is. The Js is determined by measuring the conductivity changes in the feed solution. The calcein rejection is used to determine the forward rejection properties of a membrane. Here, a fluorescent marker, that is easily detectable by a desktop fluorometer (e.g. Qubit fluorometer, Invitrogen), is added to the feed solution. By measuring its concentration in draw we can determine how much of the marker is rejected.\\n\\n\\nWater flux is calculated as following:\\n\\nJw=Vt/(A*t) ; [L/m2h],\\n\\nwhere Vt is the transported Volume, A the active membrane area and t the time in hours. To determine the reverse salt flux we have to measure the conductivity in the feed solution. With the help of a calibration curve we can then relate the conductivity to a salt concentration and thus calculate the reverse salt flux as follows:\\n\\n\\nJs- (cf,end*Vf,end-cf,start*Vf,start)/(A*t) ; [g/m2h],\\n\\nwhere Vf marks the start and end volume and cf the start and end concentration of salt in feed. \\n\\nThe calcein rejection is approximated by:\\n\\nca=l-((Vd,end*cca,d,end-Vd,start*cca,d,start)/(Vt*cca,f,start))\\n\\nWhere Vd is the start and end draw volume and cca,d the calcein reads in the draw solution. The starting concentration of calcein in feed (cca,f) is taken as a constant. This is an approximation because a membrane that rejects calcein will up-concentrate the calcein concentration in feed. However, this can be tolerated because by leaving the start concentration constant in the calculation we underestimate the total rejection, which is \\n\\nacceptable. \\n\\nTable 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes: a counter-current flow; ab draw on inside & counter-current flow; d according to Ex. 1. HF module No. 12-0644 has been modified with thin film layer only without vesicles and/or protein and thus represents prior art as disclosed by Sukitpaneenit & Chung 2012.\\n\\n\\nTable 1 clearly shows that when using the HF module of the invention it is possible to obtain a greater water flux, Jw, of up to 3 L/m2h above the flux obtainable for a thin film modified HF module having 9 fibers while still maintaining a good Js/Jw ratio of as low as about 0.22. This will be an advantage for filtration purposes, where a high water flux is desirable while less efficient salt retention can be tolerated, e.g. in the treatment of wastewater. The results according to the invention shown in Table 1 are all obtained using counter-current flow, which could prove an advantage for high water flux. \\n\\nTable 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes: a counter-current flow; c draw on inside; dd prepared according to Ex. 3. HF module No. 12-0644 has been modified with thin film layer only without vesicles and/or protein and thus represents prior art as disclosed by Sukitpaneenit & Chung 2012.\\n\\n\\nTable 2 clearly shows that using the HF module of the invention it is possible to obtain an increase in reverse salt retention, Js, of about 0.5 g/m h corresponding to a 25 % increase compared to the reverse salt retention obtainable for a thin film modified HF module having 9 fibers while still maintaining a good water flux of about 8 to 9 L/m h. These results are obtained using co-current flow with the draw solution on the inside of the HF module fibers. All of the above calcein rejection values are better than 99 % showing that the HF modules used are extremely tight (no membrane leakage). The HF module of the invention can be used with both co-current flow and counter-current flow, and as seen in the results above it can be preferred to have counter-current flow. In that case the differences in osmotic pressure are more evenly distributed over the whole length of the fiber. When both feed and draw solutions enter at the same side (co-current flow), then water is immediately pulled out of the feed stream into the draw stream, and along the fiber the difference in osmotic pressure will decrease rapidly (feed is concentrated and draw diluted). When the HF module is now operated with counter-current flow, then we have a cleaner feed meeting a diluted draw in one end and a high osmotic draw meeting a weakly osmotic feed (salt contaminated) at the other end. So the osmotic pressure difference between both liquids is closer to being the same along the length of the fiber. \\n\\nThis might favour counter-current flow. However, what speaks in favour of co-current flow is that the pressure which is generated by pumping inside is met with an equal pressure that is generated by pumping on the outside of the fiber.\\n\\nTable 3 showing results from 4 runs using the alternative method described above (PHF22)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4 showing results from 4 runs using the alternative method described above (PHF22)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 5 showing results from 4 runs using the alternative method described above (PHF22)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inside coating of HF MicroPES TF10 5 cm2 active membrane area hollow fibre modules resulted in high reproducibility; All experiments in Tables 3 and 4 have comparable Js/Jw ratios with varying Jw and Js which can be due to \\n\\ndifferences/tolerances in experiments, differences in measuring accuracy, and possibly due to the fact that the coating was a hand-made process. Thus, the two different experiments resulted in HF modules having comparable Js/Jw but varying average ranges of Jw and Js, cf. Table 3 showing experimental results of moderate Jw and low Js, and Table 4 showing experimental results of high Jw and moderate Js.\\n\\n\\nExample 4.

Tables 6 and 7showing experimental results with 2M NaCl as draw solution and Table 6 showing experimental results with 1M NaCl draw solution where a reduction in water flux is notable in contrast to a minor reduction in reverse salt flux \\n\\nExample 6. Hollow fibers outside continuous coating tests \\n\\nPurpose of this experiment is to establish a method of continuous coating on the outside of hollow fiber membranes via an automatized production process.\\n\\nMaterials \\n\\nThe machine and fibers are provided by Membrana and the coating chemicals and AqpZ vesicles are the same as used in the previous examples. The different hollow fiber membranes tested are MicroPES® TF10 and the DuraPES® 0.7 (Membrana GmbH, Wupperthal, Germany). Thus, the final coating holds an immobilized liquid membrane component containing aquaporin proteins.\\n\\n\\nMethods \\n\\nFigure 4 illustrates in the form of a sketch the automatized continuous outside coating of hollow fibers (shown as a narrow line). In the figure: (1) is a coil of uncoated hollow fibers, preferably of a porous polyethersulfone (or polysulfone and the like) material.\\n\\nFrom here they are transported into the aquaporin liquid membrane/MPD bath (2) where the aquaporin vesicles will soak into the fiber and attach to its surface. Excess \\n\\nMPD/aquaporin solution is removed during a drying step (3) where an air knife can be used to enhance excess solution removal. From here the fiber passes into the TMC/ isoalkane hydrocarbon solvent bath where the interfacial polymerization takes place (4). Thus the aquaporin vesicles (proteopolymersomes of the liquid membrane) are encapsulated due to the TFC layer formed on the fiber. A drying step (5) ensures that all of the organic solution is evaporated before dipping the fiber into a water bath to remove left-over chemicals (6). Now the fiber is wound up on a new coil. The coated hollow fibers are then cut to the appropriate length and built into modules suitable for FO water extraction and separation purposes.\\n\\n\\nExample 7. Hollow fiber module retention and up-concentration assay of two small peptides. \\n\\nIn this example we used HF modules having 5cm2 active area prepared according to Example 3 above.\\n\\n\\nPeptide A: GGG SGA G T MW 0.692 kDa \\n\\n100 mL of GGG SGA GKT peptide (MW 0.692 kDa) in TES buffer (feed solution) was filtered through a forward osmosis HF module until desired up-concentration \\n\\n(approximately 20x) using 1M NaCl as draw solution. The weight of the up-concentrated sample was measured to determine the volume reduction from the initial start sample. 10 &#956;&#912; of the up-concentrated sample was mixed with 90 &#956;&#912; of 1 Ox TES buffer to eliminate the up-concentration factor of the buffer when determining the end concentration of the up-concentrated peptide sample. The total sample of 100 &#956;&#912; was then mixed with 100 &#956;&#912; of LavaPep quantification kit, incubated for 1 h in room temperature and then the fluorescence counts were read in a QuBit fiuorometer (Invitrogen). The fluorescence counts were then compared to a standard curve where the actual concentration of the peptide sample was determined. From the same initial up-concentrated peptide sample, three samples (n=3) were prepared and measured in the Qubit and the mean fluorescent count number was used to determine the concentration from the standard curves. The sample volume was concentrated about 20 times, and the peptide A was up-concentrated about 18 to 19 times.\\n\\n\\nPeptide B: AGKT MW 0.375 kDa (experimental conditions closely corresponding to those described above for peptide A). \\n\\n100 mL of AGKT peptide (MW 0.375 kDa) in TES buffer was run until desired up-concentration (approximately 20x) with the FO hollow fiber module. The mass of the up-concentrated sample was measured to determine the volume reduction from the initial start sample. The up-concentrated sample was then diluted 4 times with TES buffer to generate a 5 times up-concentrated peptide sample prior to further sample processing. This is done to avoid the quenching of the fluorescent signal for the smaller peptide as it has been observed in previous assays. 10 &#956;&#912; of the 5x up-concentrated sample was mixed with 90&#956;1 of &#921;&#927;&#967; TES buffer to eliminate the up-concentration factor of the buffer when determining the end concentration of the up- concentrated peptide sample. The total sample of 100 &#956;&#912; was then mixed with 100 &#956;&#912; of LavaPep quantification kit, incubated for 1 h in room temperature and then the fluorescence counts were read in a QuBit fiuorometer (Invitrogen). The fluorescence counts were then compared to a standard curve where the actual concentration of the peptide sample was determined. From the same initial up-concentrated peptide sample, three samples (n=3) were prepared and measured in the Qubit and the mean fluorescent count number was used to determine the concentration from the standard curves. The sample volume was concentrated about 21 times, and the peptide B was up-concentrated about 24 times.\\n\\n\\nIn both cases the up-concentration factor of the sample peptides A and B corresponds to the reduction factor of the volume, thus leading to the conclusion that the Hollow Fiber modules having an active aquaporin-TFC layer on the inside can be used to up-concentrate biomolecules at least down to sizes of 0.375 kDa.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and equipment: \\n\\nPeptides: GGG SGA GKT purchased from CASLO \\n\\nTES: N-(Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl)-2-aminomethanesulfonic acid), Sigma Aldrich, Cas 7365-44-8 \\n\\nLavaPep peptide quantification kit: Purchased from www.lavapep.com \\n\\nPart A (LP-022010) \\n\\nPart B (LP-022010) \\n\\nQubit fluorometer, Invitrogen \\n\\nCatalog number: Q32857 \\n\\nSerial number: 45257-233 \\n\\nMeasurement setting: Quant-iT ssDNA \\n\\nTES buffer, lOOmL \\n\\nm (TES) = 229.8 mg \\n\\nm(EDTA) = 37.2mg \\n\\nAdjust pH with 1M NaOH to 8 and fill up with mQ water.

Hollow fiber module retention of creatinine \\n\\nIn this example we will, i.a., use HF modules having 5cm active area prepared according to Example 3 above. The purpose is to determine the retention rate of creatinine (MW 113.12 g mol 1), which occurs naturally in blood and urine. If the filtration in the kidney is deficient, creatinine blood levels will rise. The creatinine level in blood and urine is commonly used to calculate the creatinine clearance (CrCl), which correlates with the glomerular filtration rate (GF ) which is clinically important as a measurement of renal function.\\n\\nCreatinine assay \\n\\nCreatinine in a sample is detected with the Creatinine Assay kit from abeam (ab65340). In the assay creatinine is converted to creatine by creatinase, creatine is converted to sarcosine which reacts with a probe to generate red color (lambda max = 570 nm) and fluorescence (Ex/Em=538/587 nm).\\n\\n\\nThe instructions of the kit are followed without alterations. Creatininase, creatinase and creatine enzyme mix are reconstituted with 220 &#956;&#912; of Assay Buffer each and aliquoted prior to use to avoid freeze and thaw cycles. Creatinine standard is reconstituted with 100 &#956;&#912; of deionized H20 to generate lOOmM Creatinine Standard. For the colorimetric assay the creatinine standard is diluted a hundred times in Assay Buffer to generate a working stock solution of 1 nmol/&#956;&#912;. A dilution series is prepared where 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 &#956;&#912; of the working solution is mixed in assay buffer to a final volume of 50 &#956;&#912;.\\n\\n\\nFor each sample a reaction mix is prepared with the following volumes. \\n\\nAssay Buffer: 42 &#956;&#912; \\n\\nCreatinase 2 &#956;&#912; \\n\\nCreatininase: 2 &#956;&#912; \\n\\nEnzyme mix: 2 &#956;&#912; \\n\\nProbe: 2 &#956;&#912;\\n\\n\\nThe background reaction mix contains the same reagents except for Creatininase. The amount of Assay Buffer is 44 &#956;&#912; instead. The standard samples (50 &#956;&#912;) are mixed with the reaction mix (50 &#956;&#912;), incubated at 37 °C for one hour. O.D. is measured in micro cuvettes at 570 nm and the background is subtracted from all the samples. O.D. is then plotted against the concentration to generate a standard curve.\\n\\n\\nFor creatinine samples in hollow fibers the same procedure will be done where the up-concentrated sample will be diluted 100 times in Assay Buffer and 50 &#956;&#912; of the resulting sample will be mixed with 50 &#956;&#912; of the reaction mix. The measured O.D. value will be \\n\\nmeasured and the concentration of the sample will be determined from the standard curves. \\n\\nReferences \\n\\nAll documents mentioned in this specification are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. \\n\\nPanu Sukitpaneenit and Tai-Shung Chung, Environmental Science & Technology, 2012, 46, 7358-7365 \\n\\nNiwa T.

It is not possible to stop an earthquake from taking place, as it is a natural phenomenon beyond the control of man. Hence, man has always endeavoured to learn of an earth quake as early as possible and take the best possible preventive measures to avoid losses as far as feasible. As a result, many earthquake early detection and alarm systems have been made and are available in the market.\\nHowever, most of them use high end technology and instruments which make them very expensive and out of reach of the majority of population including small institutions like a school, hostel or small hotel.\\nMoreover, many of the earthquake alarms of the prior art demand continuous maintenance to keep them in good working condition. They also need trained manpower to operate them. These are hurdles that prevent their deployment in many places, particularly in remote and underdeveloped areas of any country.\\nTherefore, there is a great need in the industry for an earthquake alarm that is cost effective, being simple in construction, and easy to operate and maintain. At the same time, the alarm should be fast-acting and dependable. The present invention seeks to provide an earthquake alarm device which meets these needs.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\\n\\nThe primary object of the present invention is to provide an earthquake alarm device that is simple in construction, cost-effective and capable of quick detection of earthquake wave and instantaneous issuance of alarm signal.\\nAnother object of the invention is to provide an earthquake alarm device that can be manufactured from components that are easily available in most places.\\nYet another object of the invention is to provide an earthquake alarm device that can be operated by almost anybody without any special training.\\nAnother object of the invention is to provide an ‘earthquake alarm device’ that is fast acting and dependable.\\nA further object of the invention is to provide an earthquake alarm device that does not have any high technology components. \\nHow the foregoing objects are achieved will be clear from the following description.

Each sensor is designed to work together or individually for detecting earthquake vibrations and issuing alarm. \\nThe plastic bar is suspended from an upper cap fitted on said pipe such that it forms a barrier between the photo-sender and receiver of each sensor in the steady state, preventing the sensors from being deactivated when there is no earthquake. The width of the plastic bar controls the setting of the Richter scale for earthquake alarm that the device is preset to detect. The PVC pipe has a diameter ranging between 350 and 425 mm, most preferably 380 mm.\\nThe housing is provided with an input 220V AC power supply and a 2-pin plug point for optional outdoor lighting on one side face.

The number of components shown is exemplary and not restrictive and it is within the scope of the invention to vary the shape and size of the apparatus as well as the number of its components, without departing from the principle of the present invention.  \\nAll through the specification including the claims, the technical terms and abbreviations are to be interpreted in the broadest sense of the respective terms, and include all similar items in the field known by other terms, as may be clear to persons skilled in art. Restriction or limitation if any referred to in the specification, is solely by way of example and understanding the present invention.\\nFigure 1A shows the housing of the earthquake alarm device of the invention. It has provision for input 220V AC power supply (11). A 2-pin plug point (14) for optional outdoor lighting is provided on one side of the housing, as also an arrangement of switches and indicators provided on a panel on a side face of the housing, best shown in figure 1B. A siren (6) is installed behind a perforated opening provided in the body of the housing. At the bottom of the housing, LED lights (7) are mounted which are automatically switched on as soon as earthquake vibration reaches the device and the device is activated.\\n\\nFigure 1B shows a blown-up view of the arrangement of switches and indicators made on a panel provided on a side face of the housing shown in figure 1A. A beep switch (12) is provided for putting off the siren during installation of the device. A power switch (13) is provided for switching the whole device on or off. \\n \\nThe battery can be put on charging without the device being switched on, by means of this switch. There is a plurality of LED indicators (9) in this panel. A ‘power on’ indicator (red) shows that the device is receiving power from the mains. The charging indicator (green) glows when the battery is charging. There are two sensor signal indicators. LED for Sensor 1 signal (white) or sensor 2 signal (white) goes off when the device is ready to operate. These indicators are on when the sensors are not ready and the device is in the process of installation.  \\n\\nFigure 2 shows a layout of the components of the device within the housing. The housing has the main control board (5), the central element (10) having sensors (1, 2), best shown in figure 4, a siren (6), a battery (4) and a charging unit (3) installed within it, while LED indicators (9) and the switches (12, 13) on the panel  are positioned on its external side face, as mentioned above.\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the electrical circuit of the device. 220V AC power supply (11) is connected to feed power to charging unit (3) containing a transformer. The output of charging unit (3) is connected to a 12V rechargeable battery (4) for charging it. The battery is connected downstream to main control board (5). \\n\\nThe main control board (5) is connected to two sensors (1, 2) within the central element (10). The sensors are activated as soon as an earthquake wave of a preset magnitude in the Richter scale is detected by the central element (10), best shown in figure 4. Instantaneously, the main control board (5) is activated, which simultaneously switches on the siren (6), the plurality of LED indicators (9) provided on the panel on the housing and the automatic LED lights (7) mounted at the bottom of the housing. The siren gives audio warning to the users that an earthquake has been detected. The LED indicators display the status of the different elements of the device. The automatic LED lights (7) are provided to illuminate the room for people to escape, as almost all earthquakes are accompanied by consequential disruption of electricity. Additionally, optional additional staircase lights (8), which are connected externally to the housing, are also switched on at the same instant by the main control board for further ease in evacuation during the power failure, consequential to an event of earthquake.\\n\\nFigure 4 shows the central element (10) of the earthquake alarm device. It comprises of a PVC pipe (15) having a diameter ranging between 350 and 425 mm, most preferably 380 mm, where the main activity takes place. A plastic bar (16) of suitable length, width and thickness is suspended from an upper cap fitted on the pipe (15) with a hanging clip and a flexible wire. Two photoelectric sensors (1, 2) are mounted inside the pipe in such a way that the photo-sender and receiver of each sensor are placed on diametrically opposite inner faces of the pipe (15) on the same horizontal plane. \\n\\nAs shown in figure 5, the main control board (5) comprises of a PCB and a timer.\\nThe device according to the present invention is unique with respect to its operation. It uses photoelectric sensors which are suitably located inside a control unit, so that the time required to generate an alarm is very much reduced compared to the devices that are in vogue. The device has been designed as a decorative showpiece with a soothing landscape picture on the front of the housing, which is meant to be mounted on a wall by suitable supports. In case of earthquakes measuring more than 3.5 in the Richter scale, the device is designed to produce an audio warning through a built-in siren. In addition, an LED lamp provided at the bottom of the housing lights up the room in the night for ease of taking precautionary actions.\\nThe device operates on domestic 220V AC supply. Additionally is has a battery backup for operating during power cuts lasting up to 15 days if fully charged.\\nIf power cut takes place in the night due to the earth quake shock, one extra staircase light can be fitted additionally besides the built-in automatic emergency LED room–light back up. This is optional.\\n\\nThe device is calibrated to operate for quake levels of 3.5 or more in the Richter scale. To give an idea, the vibration that sets in due to a road roller is considerably less than 3.5 in the Richter scale. Therefore this setting of the device is considered practical, and is meant to generate correct response to earthquakes of minor or major nature. The only requirement is that the battery is kept ready and recharged.\\nThe instrument is to be hung and set on the wall so fixed as not to tilt due to wind circulation in the room, where it is meant to be placed. In case the battery is not working, any indicator fitted to the device does not glow. Therefore, the battery has to be monitored regularly. \\n\\nInstallation of the device:\\nAs mentioned before, the device is to be installed inside a room, specifically on one of its walls. Before starting installation, beep switch (12) is to be turned off, so that the siren (6) does not go off accidentally, in case the sensors get activated during the installation. The device must be hung on the wall and secured so that its position is not altered by wind circulation within the room. The plastic bar (16) suspended within the PVC pipe (15) must remain vertical for the device to operate properly. During installation, the bar must provide a barrier between the senders and receivers of both sensors (1, 2), so that the sensors remain deactivated.\\n\\nOperation:\\nIt is well known that a sensor is activated as soon as the light emitted by its sender is received by its receiver. The plastic bar (16) is suspended within the pipe (15) in such manner that it provides a barrier between the senders and receivers of both sensors (1, 2), so that the sensors remain deactivated during steady state, i.e. when there is no earthquake. The sensors are also accordingly located, as explained above. The bar is so placed between the sensor sender-receiver pairs, that in case of a movement of the bar, either in the vertical or in horizontal planes, at least one of the sender-receiver pairs gets connected and the respective sensor is activated. \\n\\nThe plastic bar (16) has a rectangular cross section having a certain width and thickness. The width of the bar is the factor which controls the setting of the Richter scale for earthquake alarm that the device is calibrated to detect. As the width goes up, the Richter scale setting of the device also goes up.\\nIt has been tested in the laboratory that a bar having only a specific width can detect a minimum earthquake level of 3.5. The bar is suspended in a way so that the center of its width lies in the path of the sender-receiver pair of each sensor. In this particular arrangement, the mid-point of the bar width, equidistant from either edge of the bar, must be the path for the sensor light stream. Hence the bar is required to move at least by this width in either direction for the sensor to be activated. This displacement is produced by an earthquake of 3.5 Richter. \\nIt should be understood that the magnitude at which the device can be preset to respond to a certain Richter scale can be reduced and increased by reducing and increasing the width of the bar respectively, and this is within the scope of the present invention.\\nNow, whenever an earthquake of magnitude 3.5 or above in the Richter scale occurs, the plastic bar (16) starts to move in different directions within the PVC pipe where it is suspended from the top. It moves by an amount which is enough to clear the barrier created by it between the sender of the sensor of at least one sensor and its receiver, as explained above. The sensors thus get activated, i.e. earthquake is detected by the device.\\nAs soon as at least one sensor is activated, the device of the present invention operates. However, there are two sensors provided in the device by way of adequate redundancy. Even if one sensor fails to get activated, another will. So, either of Sensor-1 or Sensor- 2 or both send the signal to the main board (5), which in no time sends simultaneous commands to light the indicators (9), blow the siren (6) and switch on the bottom LED-light (7) to warn its user about the situation. In case optional emergency staircase lights (8) are provided, the main control board switches them on too at the same instant.\\n\\nThe main control board (5) is used to receive the signal produced by the contact of the sensor points/parts (in any sensor), and send the output to the timer board to start siren (6) and activate LED Lamp (7), as well as staircase lamps (8), if connected. Once any sensor switches ‘ON’, siren (6) and LED lamp (7) start functioning together for 15 seconds and then cut themselves out automatically.
